# Julia on HPC systems

The purpose of this repository is to document best practices for running Julia
on HPC systems (i.e., "supercomputers"). At the moment, both information
relevant for supercomputer operators as well as users is collected here.
There is no guarantee for permanence or that information here is up-to-date,
neither for a useful ordering and/or categorization of issues.


## For operators

### Official Julia binaries vs. building from source
According to 
[this Discourse post](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/compiling-julia-using-lto-pgo/39168/5),
the difference between compiling Julia from source with architecture-specific
optimization and using the official Julia binaries is negligible.
This has been confirmed by [Ludovic Räss](#acknowledgments) for an Nvidia DGX-1
system at CSCS, where also no performance differences between a Spack-installed
version and the official binaries were found (April 2022).

Since installing from source using, e.g., Spack, can sometimes be cumbersome,
the general recommendation is to go with the pre-built binaries unless
benchmarked and found to be different.

* This is also the current approach on NERSC's systems

### Ensure correct libraries are loaded
When using Julia on a system that uses an environment-variable based module
system (such as [modules](https://github.com/cea-hpc/modules) or
[Lmod](https://github.com/TACC/Lmod)), the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable might
be filled with entries pointing to different packages and libraries. To avoid
issues from Julia loading another library instead of the ones packaged with
Julia, make sure that Julia's `lib` directory is always the *first* directory in
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

One possibility to achieve this is to create a wrapper shell script that
modifies `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before calling the Julia executable. Inspired by a
[script](https://github.com/UCL-RITS/rcps-buildscripts/blob/04b2e2ccfe7e195fd0396b572e9f8ff426b37f0e/files/julia/julia.sh)
from UCL's [Owain Kenway](https://github.com/owainkenwayucl):
```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This wrapper makes sure the julia binary distributions picks up the GCC
# libraries provided with it correctly meaning that it does not rely on
# the gcc-libs version.

location=$(readlink -f $0)
directory=$(readlink -f $(dirname ${location})/..)

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${directory}/lib/julia:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
exec ${directory}/bin/julia "$@"
```

Note that using `readlink` might not be optimal from a performance perspective
if used in a massively parallel environment. Alternatively, hard-code the Julia
path or set an environment variable accordingly.

Also note that fixing the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable does not seem to be a hard
requirement, since it is not used universally (e.g., it is not necessary on NERSC's systems).

### Julia depot path
There is no clear consensus where the Julia depot folder (by default on
Unix-like systems: `~/.julia`) should be located.  On some systems that have
good I/O connectivity, it resides in the user's home directory, e.g., at NERSC.
On other systems, e.g., at CSCS, it is put on a scratch file system. At the time
of writing (April 2022), there does not seem to be reliable performance data
available that could help to make a data-based decision.

If the depot path, which can be controlled by the
[`JULIA_DEPOT_PATH`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/environment-variables/#JULIA_DEPOT_PATH)
variable, is located on a scratch/workspace file system with automatic deletion
of unused files, it must be ensured that there is a mechanism (either
operator-provided or documented and in userspace) to prevent the deletion of
files.
In case multiple platforms share a single home directory, it might
make sense to make the depot path platform dependend by setting the
`JULIA_DEPOT_PATH` environment variable appropriately, e.g.,
```
prepend-path JULIA_DEPOT_PATH $env(HOME)/.julia/$platform
```
where `$platform` contains the current system name
([source](https://gitlab.blaschke.science/nersc/julia/-/blob/e63483ff9d356128814571b181760acaaf16ecbe/modulefiles/templates/julia_cray_module.tcl#L45)).


### MPI.jl
On the NERSC systems, there is a pre-built MPI.jl for each programming
environment, which is loaded through a settings module. More information on the
NERSC module file setup can be found [here](#modules-file-setup).


### CUDA.jl
It seems to be generally advisable to set the environment variable
```bash
JULIA_CUDA_USE_BINARYBUILDER=false
```
in the module files when loading Julia on a system with GPUs. Otherwise, Julia
will try to download its own BinaryBuilder.jl-provided CUDA stack, which is
typically *not* what you want on a production HPC system. Instead, you should
make sure that Julia finds the local CUDA installation by setting relevant
environment variables (see also the
[CUDA.jl
docs](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/installation/troubleshooting/#Could-not-find-a-suitable-CUDA-installation)).


### Modules file setup
[Johannes Blaschke](https://github.com/jblaschke) provides scripts and
templates to set up modules file for Julia on some of NERSC's systems:<br>
https://gitlab.blaschke.science/nersc/julia/-/tree/main/modulefiles

There are a number of environment variables that should be considered to be set
through the module mechanism:
* [`JULIA_DEPOT_PATH`](#julia-depot-path): Ensure depot path is on the correct file
                                           system
* [`JULIA_CUDA_USE_BINARYBUILDER`](#cudajl): Use system-provided CUDA stack


### Easybuild resources
[Samuel Omlin](https://github.com/omlins) and colleagues from CSCS provide their
Easybuild configuration files used for Piz Daint online at
https://github.com/eth-cscs/production/tree/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/j/Julia. For example, there are configurations available for
[Julia 1.7.2](https://github.com/eth-cscs/production/blob/d6d0802746db0dcdea1cf1711ae1d21858058fcf/easybuild/easyconfigs/j/Julia/Julia-1.7.2-CrayGNU-21.09.eb)
and for
[Julia 1.7.2 with CUDA support](https://github.com/eth-cscs/production/blob/d6d0802746db0dcdea1cf1711ae1d21858058fcf/easybuild/easyconfigs/j/Julia/Julia-1.7.2-CrayGNU-21.09-cuda.eb).
Looking at these files also helps to decide which kind of environment variables
are useful to set.


### Further resources
* There is a lengthy discussion on the Julia Discourse about how to set up a
  centralized Julia installation. Some of it is already dated (probably), but
  it gives a good overview of some best practices and about approaches that work
  (and some which do not). In particular, the summary from CSCS is very helpful:<br>
  https://discourse.julialang.org/t/how-does-one-set-up-a-centralized-julia-installation/13922/32
* NERSC's [Johannes Blaschke](https://github.com/jblaschke) has a nice repository set up with lots
  of scripts and helpful information on setting up Julia on Cori and
  Perlmutter:<br>
  https://gitlab.blaschke.science/nersc/julia/-/tree/main
